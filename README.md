# Reddit-Scrape-Bot
Scrapes Reddit (default is set to r/buildapcsales) for deals and posts them to your server - however this bot lets the user set up custom keywords and ONLY shows the posts that contain those keywords!

Please create and use your own bot for a SINGLE server. Currently, the bot DOES NOT support multi-server setups. It is also currently not utilizing a file system to save keywords in case of bot shutdown - this is being worked on.

Check the Wiki for how to utilize this code.
